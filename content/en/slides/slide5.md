## Programme of activities of the Association

Drafting of a feasibility project consisting of:

- A. Plano-altimetric survey and digitisation of the whole territory of San Giovanni Lipioni, both the inhabited part
  and the land:

  - Preparation of the cartography and basic data ( Summary registry of both the built-up part and indications on the
    agricultural/woodland part) and technical/graphic and digital elaborations useful for the survey;

  - Identification, by the board of directors, of the subject/s to be entrusted with the "photography" of the state of
    affairs (collaboration with qualified university bodies is also envisaged);

  - Execution of inspections with the drawing up of videos/photos/thematic charts on the buildings of potential interest
    for the purposes of the project and eventual indication/analysis/description of the unbuilt fabric

  - Restitution of the surveyed data in digital format.

- B. Design and implementation of the Internet communication project;

  - Analysis and technical evaluation of the actions to be put in place for the dissemination of the project on the web
    in order to optimise institutional communication and promote the Association. This will involve the creation of a
    platform that will allow dissemination, exchanges and contacts (Website, Social media, Newletter) as well as an area
    reserved for members for the Association's activities. The Board of Directors, with the contribution of the members
    who have given their availability, will evaluate the person to whom the service will be entrusted.
