* on the proposal of the Board of Directors, will evaluate the results of the work carried out so far and, if the conditions are right to formulate proposals for the development of activities, may indicate the most appropriate forms and levels of detail (master plan, feasibility proposals, rather than the presentation of types of economic activities that can be carried out, etc.) with the help of experts in the field (tax, corporate, technical and tourism).

At the end of the meeting, the board of directors

* Will illustrate to the assembly the possible consequent scenarios that will be the basis of subsequent choices that members can undertake both in the associative and individual form.
