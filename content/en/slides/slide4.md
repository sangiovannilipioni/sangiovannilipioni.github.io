In order to implement the programme, the full support and synergy of the Municipal Administration is fundamental, in
order to support the initiative from an administrative and procedural point of view; in fact, the function of
"facilitator" body and activation of all the activities falling within the municipal competence is fundamental to the
realisation of the project itself.

For example, the efficiency of public services, the availability of advanced technological networks (fast and/or
ultra-fast WI-FI network) and the enhancement of existing municipal facilities.
