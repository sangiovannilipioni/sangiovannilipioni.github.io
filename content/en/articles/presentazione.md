<img class="float-left mr-4 img-fluid" style="max-width: 40%;" src="/jpg/sangiovannilipioni-04.jpg"/>**San Giovanni Lipioni** is a small town in the hilly interior of Abruzzo, located at 545 m above sea level on the left side of the river Trigno, on the border with Molise. The territory in which it is located gradually slopes down towards the Adriatic Sea, from which it is only 40 km away. In the opposite direction, however, the cultivated hilly landscape tends to become mountainous and is covered with meadows and woods. The "_NO ONE EXCLUDED_" Association was founded in San Giovanni Lipioni in June 2020. Promoted by some non-residents of San Giovanni Lipioni, it was born after a process of information and involvement of a large part of the resident and non-resident population. The name "_NO ONE EXCLUDED_" indicates the will of the promoters to operate in a spirit of inclusion, openness towards everyone and for the good of the entire community.

Today the Association has 50 members. We are of different ages, but we have in common a bond maintained or built over time with the town and the territory, which we wish to enrich and strengthen with concrete initiatives.

Many of us have known the village as it was after the war, in the 1950s and 1960s, when the population was still large and lived the hard life of the peasant world of the time. Then depopulation, as a result of migration, was progressive and inexorable. Attempts to slow it down, to achieve something in the area, have not been sufficient. Today the decline has reached a very low point and so we are at a crossroads, either total decline or a revival.

Paradoxically, abandonment has maintained an unspoilt environment and has left a large unused building stock that retains almost all of its original character. These and other resources, such as the typical hilly landscape, the gastronomy and the willingness of people to welcome people, can now be enhanced. First and foremost, we want to respond to the ever-increasing demand in Italy and Europe for new, experiential and eco-sustainable tourism that brings tourists into contact with different but authentic geographical realities.

The model of urban, modern life, which until now has represented an aspiration and a goal of progress, today presents numerous criticalities due to the lack of a direct relationship with nature, stressful rhythms of life and the lack of community and solidarity relations.

With a long-term vision, we want to contribute to creating a positive image of our reality by encouraging the development of individual and associated initiatives consistent with this vision. Our compasses are twofold: the preservation and enhancement of the territory and the landscape and the attention to the well-being of the inhabitants.

Today, inland areas are once again the focus of attention in public policy, so our aim is to undertake any project that can help our territories to recover and grow.
